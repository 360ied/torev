# torev
tor reverse proxy

## Usage
Run `torev`. It will generate a configuration file. You can edit it if you wish, but the defaults should be fine for most web services.
Once it has started, it will print the address of the hidden service into stdout. Look out for the `[STARTED]` message and the really long and random string. That's what you want to put in your browser (or other program).
